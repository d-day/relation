description:
                    A library to model relationships between two objects that are subclasses of
                    Ord.
                    .
                    Instead using a Map structure we use a two Maps that allows 
                    fast searching either by the key element or the value element.
                    .
                    Each of Map is between an element and a set of values. 
                    Thus careful coordination of operations is required.
                    . 
                    This library lacks of extensive testing, formal testing or automated testing.
                    Also in comparison to Data.Set or Data.Map (which provide the underlying
                    infrastructure used) there are some missing methods.
                    . 
                    Two small examples are currently provided.
                    .
